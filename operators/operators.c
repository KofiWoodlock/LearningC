    Arithmetic operators 

    + (addition) -> adds two numbers 
    - (subtraction) -> subtracts two numbers 
    * (multiplication) -> multiplies two numbers 
    / (division) -> divides two numbers 
    % (modulus) -> returns the remainder of a division 
    ++ (increment) -> increments a number by one
    -- (decrement) -> decrements a number by one

    Augmented assingment operators -> used to replace an assignment statement where a variable is one of the arguments 
    Example: x = x + 5 can be replaced with x += 5

    += x (adds x to a variables)
    -= x (subtracts x from a variable)
    *= x (multiplies a variable by x amount)
    /= x (divides a variable by x amount)
    x %= y (performs the modulus of y on the variable x)
